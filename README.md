# BookRecommendationSystem

## ** Description ** 
This project builds a robust Book Recommendation System leveraging the Book-Crossing dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/bookcrossing-dataset). This dataset, containing 278,858 users, 1,149,780 ratings, and information about 271,379 books, provides valuable insights into user preferences and book characteristics. These insights are used to generate personalized book recommendations tailored to individual user tastes.

## ** Loading and Preprocessing the data **
This step involves first loading all the files, understanding the data, and then data cleaning and feature engineering are employed to prepare the data for optimal recommendation model performance.

## ** Explorator Data Analysis **
In-depth analysis reveals hidden patterns, user behavior, and book attributes that drive recommendations. This step includes exploring the data, gathering insights and finally visualizing them in order to better understand the data. 

## **Result**
Finally, using the Recommendation Model(popularity based) to find and plot the **Top 10 most rated books**, **Top 10 most rated books with more than 500 reviews**, **Top 10 Countries with most authors**, **Top 10 authors with most books** and **Top 10 Publishers**.
